   - The dashboard shows a steady increase in the average selling price of cars from 1994 until a significant spike around 2018-2019. This sharp rise may be due to increased demand, inflation, or the introduction of premium models, followed by a noticeable drop, possibly due to market corrections or economic factors.

This dominance by a few key players highlights the competitive nature of the automotive industry, with these companies commanding significant influence.

3. **Total Number of Transmission Owners:**
   - There is a clear preference for automatic transmissions over manual ones, with automatic transmissions having more than double the number of owners. This trend indicates a shift in consumer preferences towards convenience and ease of use, possibly driven by advancements in automatic transmission technology.

4. **Total Fuel Types by Brand:**
   - The comparison between different fuel types shows that petrol is the most popular fuel choice, followed by diesel. CNG and LPG have a relatively smaller share, indicating that while alternative fuels are present, traditional fuel types still dominate the market. This may reflect consumer concerns about fuel availability, infrastructure, and cost.
